This file contains the current sprint information, 
it will be moved into the product backlog once the sprint has ended.

Sprint 0 (13th - 20th February)

	Tackling tasks from product backlog:
		Designing file structure

		Loading and saving functions (ongoing) 		(time: 03h) (priority: 9)
		Add in rocks (ongoing)				(time: 10h) (priority: 8)
		Create missions for user 			(time: 10h) (priority: 8)
		Build terrain (ongoing) 			(time: 10h) (priority: 6)
		Collision with terrain (ongoing) 		(time: 05h) (priority: 6)			

		Total estimated hours = 39

	Sprint plan:
		Loading and saving
			HTML5 local storage

		Add in rocks -low poly rocks for non interaction
				-then spheres for interacting with?
			Use exising sphere geometry, use perlin noise to shift vertices
			Then place them into the world
			Using scraping technique on the finished rock?
		
		Create missions for user
			Would involve creating very basic GUI first, see-through, blue? futureistic
			Go and explore this section of the map
			Go collect this rock
			Collect X of this rock, to then unlock this rock	
			Print text on screen character by character (left gui?)
				-have a initial sound to incate new mission	

		Build terrain
			Add different levels of perlin noise
				Try stack 2d simplex noise
			Add in craters and stuff
	

	Sprint progress:
	
		Sphere geometries, USED CODE FROM: http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=1253
			The used code is in the makeSphere function of the sphere.js file
			The sphere.js file might get renamed to rockGenerator or something
		Didn't want to try write sphere geometry code from scratch
		But also didn't want to import OBJ of sphere, as would be harder to change vertices

		Generate simplex noise values, save to image?
			-Could edit it
		Or directly use it in game, duno
		

	Sprint retrospective:

		Compeleted tasks: (include time and difficulties here)
			Loading and saving functions intial setup 	(time: 0.5h) (priority: 9)
				Currently just loads and saves player position
