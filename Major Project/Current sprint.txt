		Adding in leveling mechanics/Creating user missions
		Add in lighting
		Add in danger zones and death mechanics
		Add in new rocks
		Add in audio		
		Add in water/lava
		Add Different sections of terrain, different textures, bumpness etc
		Add clouds, feels so empty...		

	Minor things to do:
		Add screenshots
		Remove unused jQuery libraries
		Split myJs files into folders
		Redesign some files,  rename
		Put CSS in another file		
		Remove positionAttribLocation = calls, its now all done in glSetup
		Enable and disable attributes when rendering, dont enable all global at start

	Sprint plan:
		Create own textures from heightMaps
		Go and find this rock around these coordinates,
			Show image of rock
		Work from existing GUI screenshot
		Dont let user access certain rocks unless high enough level
		Prospecting progress bar
		Geometry shader for lighting, calculating normals
		Add dangerous areas
		Death mechanics, reset all XP and restart, fade out everything, you died
		Add new textures for new rocks
		Water/lava causing death on collision
		Particle effects over lava
		Perhaps 3 more sections of terrain, 4 big big quadrants
		Leveling mechanics, XP bar
			-prospect rock = XP
			-Access new areas based on XP
		Add types of rock
			-types of triangle rock
			-types of regular rock

	Have currently done:
		Moved buglog into github issues
		Added references file
		Improved water, each vertex now has its own direciton
			Rather than every row having a direction
			Weird spawn makes it look nice when reaches correct height
		Added own perlin noise texture
		Distoriton when rotation a bit better, lowered field of view to 0.3

		Paper UI designs
		Added little txt file as well
		
		Added diffuse lighting, commented out half code temporarily
		Added specular lighting, avaliable on textures
			-Need to calculate normals :(
			-First, lookup normals of triangle strip
			-But calcuate normal for each vertex

		Added proper texture class
			-Fix random leftover code at bottom
			-Also replace terrain with perlinTexture
