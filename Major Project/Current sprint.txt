This file contains the current sprint information, 
it will be moved into the product backlog once the sprint has ended.

Sprint 8 (10th - 17th April)
	

	Tackling tasks from product backlog:
		
		Add asteroids
		Add gas from craters

	Other tasks:

		Start unit testing
			Test that buffers aren't null and contain values?
			Test that vertices/indices are in correct proportion

			/*
			Terrain,
				test VAOs
				test there are correct x amount of values in vertices etc
				check vertices/indices ratio
				test setters/getters of terrain
				test heightmap array of correct size
			*/

		Start the report!
		Use the blackboard template
		Outline main sections and what gonna discuss in each

		The bigger the rock, the lower it should spawn
		Fix 2d rocks bug
		Perhaps lower rock numbers for efficiency

	Sprint plan:
		
		Asteroids will:
			Spawn in range of the user so they can see it
			Rotate and have particle effects behind them
			On collision will have more particle effects
			Rock will stay on floor afterwards

		Particles will 'eminate?' from the rocks centre position
		Particles will just be a straight line animating

		Gas:
			Need some sort of crater, perhaps reuse old crater code
			Then just have simple particle effects
