This file contains the current sprint information, 
it will be moved into the product backlog once the sprint has ended.

Sprint 5 (20th - 27th March) - Changed project direction to 'realism' rather than game

	Game aspects where taking ages, weren't technical and didn't them find interesting
	Now behind 1 week worth of progress, stripping out last weeks additions

	Problems
		Change project title, Mars Scene in WebGL

	Tackling tasks from product backlog:

		Small rocks					(time: 15h) (priority: 8)

		Skybox 						(time: 05h) (priority: 7)
			have sun that acts as directional light 
			small sun, and bunch of stars as well
			then can use fake the lighting on the rocks
			needed for shadows anyway

		Shadows, applied to larger rocks only		(time: 10h) (priority: 7)
	
	Sprint Plan:

		Backup project

		Strip out
			Collision, keep collision with the floor
			GUIs - Could keep MENU GUI and have another GUI, and just show rock information when in range?
			'minimap' and program/shader variables for disabling fog
			inventory
			prospecting
			resources, rock textures etc

		Also remove features from documentation
		Add flyover movement
		Fix terrain textures
		Fix noise sections
		Add new perlin seed each time

		Fix UV bug
			Instead of using 1 texture
			Just use 4, and start UV coordinates from 0 each time.
			Still doesn't work, wasted 3 hours

		Fix collision with floor		

		## Cleanup code ##

		Small rocks plan
			Find LOW poly rocks
			CAN DRAW ALL ROCKS AS INSTANCED :)
			should still split draw calls based on their textures
			assign the rocks a section, easier rendering/processing

		Need a quadrant for the rocks

		Split rock code into different render function
			and then for 'efficiency', calculate the vector to every rock?
			worst case, just make terrainVAO rendering so can take in quadrant / rocks

			store rock stuff in vao? later


			could use regular draw calls, meaning duplicating vertices in 1 buffer
				but if low poly, its ok?


	Not using existing mars heightmap
		-literally loading in an obj
