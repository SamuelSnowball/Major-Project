Sprint 8 (10th - 17th April)
	

	Tackling tasks from product backlog:
		
	Tested:
		RockGenerator
		Terrain
		
	Other tasks:
		
		Add a max height to camera
			Hate how you can fly up and see the world boundaries
			Awkward with higher terrain scale

		Controls menu, GUI
			With invert button
		Wait until textures loaded until run setup
		Load up water strength to shader, otherwise ui cant change it		
		Need perlin seed
		Need Sound
		Fix falling through the floor
		Need Compass/map
			
		Some sort of design
			Class diagram
				Add constructor as well!, methods need parameters?
				Add arrays []
				Add parameters
			Organize main boxes properly

		Helen question, what about javascript class diagrma
			everything is a variable, but having all 'vars' in class diagram is a bit weird
			instead have, vec3, even though it is just a variable?

		Start unit testing
			Test that buffers aren't null and contain values?
			Test that vertices/indices are in correct proportion

		Start the report!
		Use the blackboard template
		Outline main sections and what gonna discuss in each

	Sprint plan:
		
		Gas:
			Need some sort of crater, perhaps reuse old crater code
			Then just have simple particle effects

			Can use one translation matrix for all?
			Therefore don't have to remake matrices, 
			just update with a singular translation matrix

			Update of particles:
			https://processing.org/examples/smokeparticlesystem.html

			Will use gas particle effects for the meteor particle trails

		Asteroids will:
			Spawn in range of the user so they can see it
			Rotate and have particle effects behind them
			On collision will have more particle effects
			Rock will stay on floor afterwards

		Particles will 'eminate?' from the rocks centre position
		Particles will just be a straight line animating

		Asteroid generator class
			randomly wait until generate a new one
			Need a low poly asteroid OBJ


	Sprint retrospective:

		Fixed rock spawn height

		Added FPS counter
		Added menu system from library
