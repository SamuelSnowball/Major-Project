Sprint FINAL (1st - 8th May)

	Notes/tasks left to do:

		Talk about shader location variables in background reading
			reference in engine section

		Replace player with user, cntrl f replace if exists,

		Where does the 3D to 2D happen? it isnt projection,
			its perspective divide? but where?

		You used triangle strip stackoverflow 11 upvote code twice,
			where is the other location?

		Does the projection matrix actually convert to 2D?
			Or it leaves some depth right

		Explain about Shader locations in the background reading section

		Explain VBOs in the background reading section
		Show the thinmatrix layout of things!
		perhaps draw.io for VAO containing VBOs, and those VBOs pointing to the data.

		Discuss lighting in the background reading section
		and refernece it in implementation, for water especially

		Most of the terrain rendering code is useless, because the user
		can't even go in the corners/edges anymore. Can remove this from
		the project :(

		Talk about terrain stacked noise vs regular

		Copy from the notepad files on techincal information about lighting and water

		Smaller heading titles for subsections like in the testing section

		Change default terrain size to 8

		Water sound doesn't restart when it finishes

		Reference product and indivdual sprint backlogs
			-Separate them into files?
		Add references
		Reference images as well
		Refernece water sound
		reference old perlin noise thing code, that gnnerated the images

		How to format code in report, code samples?
		In the pipeline explanation

		Remove unncessacry resources

		Add vector explanation to scene
	
		Do I need sprint 0-9 design decision diagrams/explanations?

		Explain perlin noise in analysis section, quite lengthy
		or in background reading

		Change numbers on report, like 1.4.4. whatever
		Also change the index at the start to match these

		Make sure U mention the docs in the report!

		How on earth to describe the class diagram?
			Just split into lots of images? or images aren't needed

		RECREATE DOCUMENTATION WHEN CODE DONE

		In analysis section you talk about the main tasks,
		Should this only describe the main tasks at the start of the project?
		Or in this section should it show the project evolving?

		Need to make a user manual
			Link github 
			Say how to build/run the project
			Host the final version on ur dcs.aber.ac.uk
			Say where all documentation is, including the actual docs
			Explain controls how to play
			MAKE A USER MANUAL WITH SCREENSHOTS, CONTROLS, LOADING TIMES ET

		If you remove map boundaries, make sure no collision on out of bounds stuff, let free fly

		Report:

			Are the map boundaries/minimap even worth it? looks awful
			Could remove collision, the collision ui and minimap as well

		To test properly
			Move all files into one folder
			Generate the yuidoc
			Copy the out bit over

			COPY OVER SOURCE FILES EVERY TIME!
			COULD SYMLINK ALL SOURCE FILES AND THE OUT FOLDER TO PROJECT DOCS

		Add yuidoc pages in appendices, but where to mention them
