This file contains the current sprint information, 
it will be moved into the product backlog once the sprint has ended.

Sprint 8 (10th - 17th April)
	

	Tackling tasks from product backlog:
		
		Add asteroids
		Add gas from craters

		Possible update to water (moving the vertices!):
			https://threejs.org/examples/?q=particle#canvas_particles_waves

	Other tasks:

		Some sort of design
			Class diagram
				Add constructor as well!, methods need parameters?

		Start unit testing
			Test that buffers aren't null and contain values?
			Test that vertices/indices are in correct proportion

			/*
			Terrain,
				test VAOs
				test there are correct x amount of values in vertices etc
				check vertices/indices ratio
				test setters/getters of terrain
				test heightmap array of correct size
			*/

		Start the report!
		Use the blackboard template
		Outline main sections and what gonna discuss in each

		The bigger the rock, the lower it should spawn
		Fix 2d rocks bug
		Perhaps lower rock numbers for efficiency

	Sprint plan:
		
		Gas:
			Need some sort of crater, perhaps reuse old crater code
			Then just have simple particle effects

			Can use one translation matrix for all?
			Therefore don't have to remake matrices, 
			just update with a singular translation matrix

			Update of particles:
			https://processing.org/examples/smokeparticlesystem.html

			Will use gas particle effects for the meteor particle trails

		Asteroids will:
			Spawn in range of the user so they can see it
			Rotate and have particle effects behind them
			On collision will have more particle effects
			Rock will stay on floor afterwards

		Particles will 'eminate?' from the rocks centre position
		Particles will just be a straight line animating

		Asteroid generator class
			randomly wait until generate a new one
			Need a low poly asteroid OBJ


	Sprint retrospective:

		Fixed rock spawn height
