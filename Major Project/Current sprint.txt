Sprint 2 (27th Feb - 6th March)

	Tackling tasks from product backlog:
		Loading and saving functions (ongoing) 		(time: 03h) (priority: 9) (actual time:)
		FINISH building terrain (ongoing) 		(time: 05h) (priority: 6) (actual time:)
		Build GUIs (Minimap + nearest rock)		(time: 02h) (priority: 6) (actual time:)
		Minimap 					(time: 02h) (priority: 5) (actual time:)

	Other tasks:
		Start test table
		More work on class diagram
		Fix rocks spawning on player
		Add screenshots of stuff, water, minimap
		Change renders to dynamic draw
		
	Sprint plan:
		Bad minimap 
			4x4 grid minimap, shows current quadrant, 
			should be relativley easy
			locked sections in red, avaliable sections in blue, current in green

		Proper minimap/map
			render the scene from above, in a small portion to the side of window
			Could have really bad efficieny though
			Drawing everything again :/

			Possible solution, only render the minimap/map when the user
			holds down a key, pops up in another interface!
			Users current position gets upped by like +20y
			Then player view gets rotated straight down?
			Set gl.lookAt perhaps
			
		Load and saving
			Player position
			Current XP/Level

		Spawn user in the correct grid square

		Set noise values of 16 quadrants

		Texture all 16 quadrants
			Work on inner 4 squares first
			Have all 16 texturs on 1 atlas, so easy to use!
			Start with mid 4 images
			Move perlin scales in
			Set player spawn

		Add audio
			ambient soundtrack
			when colliding with rocks
			when prospect a rock

		Possibily work on water on GPU and spawning it randomly

		Need a bunch of rocks
		-With names
		-Then have missions telling user to explore the rocks

		If user in range of water vertices, then start updating them, else dont
		
		Fixed saving player position

	Notes:

	Added:
		Added Minimap/birds eye view
			Disables fog, widens zFar when in miniMap mode
			Otherwise, because so far away, everything would be in fog!

			In minimap mode need to widen the zFar plane so player can see alot of the map
			But then decrease back to normal, for rendering efficiney
			The user cant see past 64z anyway due to fog, why render 512z?
			Remade projectionMatrix every frame to set the zFar value

			Added player position onto minimap

			Once finished minimap, implement into game, but need to fix rendering issues first
			because will be rendering scene twice

		Changed players x,y,z to private fixed scoping issues
		Removed some triangle rocks
		Added flow diagram		

	
	Problems:
		What if player in minimap, and there position saves, then they load?
