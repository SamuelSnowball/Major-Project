Random Mars Scene vs terrain generator
	If its a randomly generated mars scene, then I can keep all lighting/fog aspects
		Just the map has boundaries
		Do I even need a lander?

Sprint 6: 27th march - 3rd april 

	Sprint plan:
		The amount of rocks
		The scale of rocks, could have double for loop if between 128,128 then scale = 100 etc
			Base the Z scale, on what the X was.
			Like zScale = (rand) + x (as min) 
		The rock texture, all rocks in quadrant need the same texture
			At render time in the renderIndices loop, meshArray.texture
			Might not be awful.
			It holds 60fps!

		Different noise sections, random
		The greater the noise scale, the less rocks

		Skybox
		Set the directional light from the sun in the skybox

	Sprint retrospective:
		Fixed amount of rocks
