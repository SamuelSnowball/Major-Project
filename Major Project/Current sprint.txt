This file contains the current sprint information, 
it will be moved into the product backlog once the sprint has ended.

Sprint 1 (20th - 27th February)

	Tackling tasks from product backlog:
		Build GUIs
		Adding in leveling mechanics/Creating user missions
		Add in lighting
		Add in danger zones and death mechanics
		Add in new rocks
		Add in audio		
		Add in water/lava
		Add Different sections of terrain, different textures, bumpness etc
		Add fog		

	Minor things to do:
		Add screenshots
		Remove unused jQuery libraries
		Split myJs files into folders
		Redesign some files,  rename
		Put CSS in another file		
		Remove positionAttribLocation = calls, its now all done in glSetup
		Enable and disable attributes when rendering, dont enable all global at start

	Sprint plan:
		Start test table, other documentation
		Create own textures from heightMaps
		Go and find this rock around these coordinates,
			Show image of rock
		Work from existing GUI screenshot
		Dont let user access certain rocks unless high enough level
		Prospecting progress bar
		Geometry shader for lighting, calculating normals
		Add dangerous areas
		Death mechanics, reset all XP and restart, fade out everything, you died
		Add new textures for new rocks
		Water/lava causing death on collision
		Particle effects over lava
		Perhaps 3 more sections of terrain, 4 big big quadrants
		Leveling mechanics, XP bar
			-prospect rock = XP
			-Access new areas based on XP
		Add types of rock
			-types of triangle rock
			-types of regular rock

	Have currently done:
		Moved buglog into github issues

		Added references file

		Improved water, each vertex now has its own direciton
			Rather than every row having a direction
			Weird spawn makes it look nice when reaches correct height

		Added own perlin noise texture
		Then exported it to image + changed colours, then imported as texture

		Distoriton when rotation a bit better, lowered field of view to 0.3

		Paper UI designs
		Added little txt file as well
		
		Added directional lighting
		Fixed bug with rotating objects
		Added diffuse lighting
		Added specular lighting, avaliable on textures

		Have given 0.5 ambient in shader

		Added proper texture class
			-Fix random leftover code at bottom
			-Also replace terrain with perlinTexture
		
		Calculated terrain normals + water normals
		Inversed my terrain and water normals, they now point right direction
		My light direction, is going the same way as the normals.... ??
		Yes, because its surfaceToLightVector, so it makes sense that they go same way!
		I think I substracted the vectors the wrong way around

		Inversed X and Z values in get terrain heightMap getters, it now works
		Terrain collision code is now perfect

		Added gaining xp when prospecting a rock	
		
		Added some map design pic + notes	

		Build simple audio class

		Notes:
			FIX ROTATION NAMES IN RENDER, THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM
			THOSE GLOBAL NAMES IN MATRICES, xRotation VS rotateX!

			MAKE SURE NORMALS GET BOUND WHEN RENDERING

			Take screenshots of lighting when fixed

			Lighting diagrams + find good references
	
			Whats with the light direction, being the same as the reversedDirection?
			Ok, I think specular is working, because when on the flat section
			of the terrain, there are no highlights whatsoever, because the normals
			are pointing straight up

			Player spawn in middle of 4x4 grid, dangerous areas towards outside
			Different quadrants have different rocks, etc

			4x4 grid minimap!!! shows current quadrant, should be relativley easy
				locked sections, avaliable sections

		Future to do:
			Set different colours for ambient, specular etc?
			Why cant i see specular highlights on water?
				-Its shimmering, because light coming from 1 direction
