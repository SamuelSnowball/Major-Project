	Tackling tasks from product backlog:
		
		Finish water

		Fix 2d rocks

		Water + reflect/ract renderng if toWaterVector < 100 etc

		Rename player to camera class
		Initialze camera to identity
		
		Set yaw/pitch properly in watersystem
		In camera setupUsermovement,
			have to add cameraTarget values
			individually?

	Commented out collision tester in main render scene
	Have commented out distortion, adding on 0 atm
	disabled fog for reflect/refract?

	His reflection texture is upside down, mine isnt
		Can just rotate water quad to fix?
		Cant rotate water quad, because
			reflection + refraction need diff rotations
	Or rotate the textures..

	Texture rotation or pitch/yaw is problem

	SKybox breaks everything
		
	The reflection is moving releative to the player,
	it shouldnt
	When player moves forward, the reflection also does


	Try and stop the reflection moving


	Sprint retrospective:

		
	Possible problems:
		Position of camera when rendering reflection
		If remove tiling, then horrible distortion on sides of screen
			In water tutorial 5, he mentions distortion
