Sprint 9 (17th - 24th April)

	Sprint retrospective:
		Mainly documentation and testing
		Report started

Copy from the notepad files on techincal information about lighting and water

Smaller heading titles for subsections like in the testing section

Change default terrain size to 8

Reference product and indivdual sprint backlogs
	-Separate them into files?
Add references
Reference images as well
Refernece water sound
reference old perlin noise thing code, that gnnerated the images

How to format code in report, code samples?
	In the pipeline explanation

Remove unncessacry resources

Add vector explanation to scene

Do I need sprint 0-9 design decision diagrams/explanations?

Explain perlin noise in analysis section, quite lengthy
or in background reading

Change numbers on report, like 1.4.4. whatever
Also change the index at the start to match these

Make sure U mention the docs in the report!

How on earth to describe the class diagram?
	Just split into lots of images? or images aren't needed

RECREATE DOCUMENTATION WHEN CODE DONE

In analysis section you talk about the main tasks,
Should this only describe the main tasks at the start of the project?
Or in this section should it show the project evolving?

Need to make a user manual
	Link github 
	Say how to build/run the project
	Host the final version on ur dcs.aber.ac.uk
	Say where all documentation is, including the actual docs
	Explain controls how to play
	MAKE A USER MANUAL WITH SCREENSHOTS, CONTROLS, LOADING TIMES ET

If you remove map boundaries, make sure no collision on out of bounds stuff, let free fly

Report:

	Are the map boundaries/minimap even worth it? looks awful
	Could remove collision, the collision ui and minimap as well

To test properly
	Move all files into one folder
	Generate the yuidoc
	Copy the out bit over

	COPY OVER SOURCE FILES EVERY TIME!
	COULD SYMLINK ALL SOURCE FILES AND THE OUT FOLDER TO PROJECT DOCS

Add yuidoc pages in appendices, but where to mention them
