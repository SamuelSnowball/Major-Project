	Sprint retrospective:
		Mainly documentation and testing
		Report started
		
		Finish class diagram

		Map/compass
			Fix lengths of barrier
			Fix barrier coming in/out of view

		Make sun a spotlight for nice specular!

Need to make a user manual
	Say how to build/run the project
	Host the final version on ur dcs.aber.ac.uk
	Say where all documentation is, including the actual docs
	Explain controls how to play

If you remove map boundaries, make sure no collision on out of bounds stuff, let free fly

Report:

	Are the map boundaries/minimap even worth it? looks awful
	In report heavy use of I in the intro section, can I avoid this?


To test properly
	Move all files into one folder
	Generate the yuidoc
	Copy the out bit over

	COPY OVER SOURCE FILES EVERY TIME!
	COULD SYMLINK ALL SOURCE FILES AND THE OUT FOLDER TO PROJECT DOCS

MAKE A USER MANUAL WITH SCREENSHOTS, CONTROLS, LOADING TIMES ETC


Email neil
Describe report in iterations?
	Would make sense

Add yuidoc pages in appendices, but where to mention them

	Minor tasks:

		Water reflection doesn't look right when moving up/down
