Random Mars Scene
-If its a randomly generated mars scene, then I can keep all lighting/fog aspects
	-Just the map has boundaries

To do:
	The amount of rocks
	The scale of rocks, could have double for loop if between 128,128 then scale = 100 etc 
	The rock texture, all rocks in quadrant need the same texture
	//At render time in the renderIndices loop, meshArray.texture
	//Might not be awful.

	Terrain texture, somehow have a realisitc noise texture

	Different noise sections, random

	Skybox
	Set the directional light from the sun in the skybox


First fix original water, on GPU

Need to generate the water first, then edit the heightmap
because you have the spawn and end points of the water

heightmap would be ok
which mean vertices would be ok

random placement of water
-would it occupy the whole cell?
-would be better to just have parts of it


Future
-allow user to set the randomness properties, through rowsxcolumns size GUI,
-clickable map squares, increment perlin scale
