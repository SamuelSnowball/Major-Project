Water lighting

The water normals are all 0,1,0 because water is a flat
quad. 

Use fake, rotated proper-look-a-like normals, even
though the water is flat

Generate these fake normals from the normal map,
to indicate the normal at different points on the
surface

Sample the R,G,B from the map, into the normal X,Y,Z

The normal map is mostly blue colour, because
blue represents the UP axis. Therefore swap the
Y axis with blue (r,b,B). Red and green match to X, Z

Can never have negative colour, therefore X,Y,Z 
normal would never be negative. But dont want this
So use a conversion to convert to between -1 and 1
rather than between 0 and 1

The normal mapped water in screenshots, is
a representation of how I'm calculating the normals.
Taking the point, and using it to calculate the normal
