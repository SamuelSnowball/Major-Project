FIXED - Terrain generation fails if using over 256 rows/columns

	Indice values exceed Uint16 indicies buffer
		Changed indices from Uint16 to Uint32 array
	Also changed drawElements call to have, 
		gl.UNSIGNED_INT instead of gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT

	Required adding: OES_element_index_uint
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OES_element_index_uint

	Project only runs on chrome, firefox
	Doesn't work on Internet explorer or EDGE
	

FIXED - Camera wasn't rotating full 360 degrees, fixed by adding in Z pos to camera target
FIXED - Cleared depth buffer each frame to fix terrain rendering
