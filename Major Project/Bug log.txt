BUG - When world loads, and user immediatley goes up Y gets set to NaN
	If user goes down, then up it works.
	Temporary fix, decrement players Y value ever so slightly, fixes it

BUG - When starting game, cannot read property NaN of undefined, setPlayerHeight, collision.js 55
BUG - Cant move forwads through a rock, but turn around, and you can move backwards through it
	If you hit a rock going forwards, then turn around, you'll get stuck
BUG - Player can spawn inside rock

FIXED - Terrain generation fails if using over 256 rows/columns

	Indice values exceed Uint16 indicies buffer
		Changed indices from Uint16 to Uint32 array
	Also changed drawElements call to have, 
		gl.UNSIGNED_INT instead of gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT

	Required adding: OES_element_index_uint
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OES_element_index_uint

	Project only runs on chrome, firefox
	Doesn't work on Internet explorer or EDGE
	

FIXED - Camera wasn't rotating full 360 degrees, fixed by adding in Z pos to camera target
FIXED - Cleared depth buffer each frame to fix terrain rendering
