8th February
	
	Fixed:
		Camera class wasn't working at all, the terrain now renders at its own
		position, rather than being based off the players position

		Camera rotation, it goes 360 degrees now

		Removed the rover going left/right as it doesn't make sense. Instead, the
		user can turn the camera and move forward to have the same effect

		Cleaned up some files
