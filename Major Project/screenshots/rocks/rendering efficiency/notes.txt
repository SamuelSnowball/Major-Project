I calculate distance from the player to the rock, if its < 128 then the rock
gets rendered. Else it doesn't.

	This image shows a rock in range of the player (within 128 units)
	Therefore it gets rendered.

	I then move back slightly, distance to rock is now 129
	And distance is now > 128, so rock doesn't get rendered

	You can see the rocks jumping in/out of being rendered, which isn't good
	But I just widen the distance, so the rendering coming in/out of range is
	covered by fog.
