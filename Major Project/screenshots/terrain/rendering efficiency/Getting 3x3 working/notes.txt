These images show the progress of my terrain processing and rendering.

My goal was to only process and render the vertices of the current,
and surrounding cells.

The images are taken at a birds eye view of the map.
The player is shown as the small red rectangle.

	Only processing terrain vertices and rendering the quadrant 
	that the player is in.
	(ignore the water/lava)

	The black lines show the quadrants

5 cells.png
	Rendering the current cell, and ones around it
	(not including diagonals)

top left.png / top right.png / bottom left.png / bottom right.png
	Processing vertices, and rendering cells
	of the 3x3 around (and including) the player

	The empty black grid cells is showing the terrain 
	that exists, but its vertices arent being rendered,
	but more importantly, those vertices arent even processed.
