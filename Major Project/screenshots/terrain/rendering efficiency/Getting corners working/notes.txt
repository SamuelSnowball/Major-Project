Tested with grid size of 4x4
Black lines on images represent cells that you cant see
Those vertices arent processed, or rendered.

When player in corner quadrant, only 4 sections should be processed and rendered.
With the 3x3 images, I was getting offscreen error because it was still trying to
render a 3x3 section, these images show it fixed.
