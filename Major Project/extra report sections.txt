What happens on CPU vs GPU

FF/Programmable
In its early days OpenGL, with version 1.x and 2.x used something called the fixed function pipeline. 
Fixed function means calculations for 3d rendering where built into the hardware, and you couldnâ€™t change it. 
How lighting/fog/texturing works. Not customizable. 
Programmable, can replace parts of the pipeline with your own code, shaders. 
Still cant change triangle rasterizer. Fixed function useful for a basic scene, easier as no writing shaders,
