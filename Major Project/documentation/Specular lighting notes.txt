Specular lighting
-reflection of light source, on the object


Reflected light, is based on incoming light + normal
	and reflectivty of surface
Also is based on where camera is, directly into camera etc


Shine damping = how close the camera needs to be to the reflected light
	to see changes



modelTexture
	shineDamper
	reflectivity

uniform for these^ attributes


Calculate specular light in shader

At any point, we have normal vector + toLightVector
We need vector from lightToPoint, so just reverse toLightVector
Then reflect the light ray
Also need a vector from the point, straight to the camera

The more the vector from point, and reflection ray are together,
the more light is going into the camera 

Find out how close the 2 vectors are pointing in same direction
Done using dot product

We now have idea of how bright point on object is, so then use
the shineDamper to edit this value

Then multiply by reflectivity of the surface,
Then add it to diffuse lighting

Need viewMatrix, out of model/transformation matrix
