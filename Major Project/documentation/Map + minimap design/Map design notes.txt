Map design, birds eye view

4x4 grid, 16 quadrants (2048x2048)
Will use various textures for different quadrants so map isnt boring
Different perlin noise for different sections
Ores for different sections

User spawns near center of the map

Lava and water spawn in random places
-will be difficult to find 

Unlock quadrants when completed certain missions

Minimap 
	very easy to make, just a 4x4 grid with their
	current cell coloured in
	Could have 'avaliable areas' and 'locked areas'
	And 'current area' highlighted
