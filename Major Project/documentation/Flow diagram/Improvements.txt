Flow diagram improvements

Add in loading screen, user presses play
Sending in vertices, normals, texture coordiantes to shaders
More testing steps, ones like depth
Rasterization
Setting frag_Color based on lighting calculations as well, fog etc

Rather than generic render, have render rocks, render terrain steps
Any GPU calculations like water, have in shaders
