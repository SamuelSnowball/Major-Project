Fesnel effect (fernel effect)

Is how the reflectivity of the water changes,
based on the viewing angle

Water is more transparent when looked at from above
And more reflective when looked at from lower angle

Calculate:
	Have water surface normal
	And camera position
	waterToCamera vector

Water should be more transparent when the two
vectors, (waterToCamera) and waterSurfaceNormal
are pointing in the same direction
And more reflective, when they're pointing in 
different directions

Take the dot product, to find out how much
they're pointing in the same direction (1)
Or 0 when they're at 90 degrees
