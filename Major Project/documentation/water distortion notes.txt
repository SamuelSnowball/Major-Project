Water distortion notes

dudv map represents distortion, at different points on waters surface

the texture is full of (red, green) values
Use these as offsets to add to reflect/refract texture coordinates

So map the dudv map over the water quad, 
Then sample it for each point on the waters surface,
to get the distortion for that point

But values in dudv are always positive, cant have negative colour,
so the distortions would always be positive

Need to make negative, currently 0->1
so convert to -1, + 1
x2 - 1 for each

Glitch on sides

Because of projective texturing, the reflect/refract texture
coordinates at the bottom of the screen are going to have
a Y value of almost 0.

Because distorting adds offset to texture coordinates,
they're sometimes going below 0

This causes the texture coord to go off the bottom, and it wraps
back around to the top
