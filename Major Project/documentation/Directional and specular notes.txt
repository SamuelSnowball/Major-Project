Directional light, with specular

We have light direction and colour, from directional lighting

Need direction of our model to the light, but our light can be anywhere...
surfaceToLightDirection is worked out by normalizing the surfaceToLightDistance
	-so just ignore the distance as it doesn't make sense
	-and set surfaceToLightDirection as the uniform direction, always the same

Also need direction from surface to camera

Add the 2 vectors and normalize them, gives us halfVector, sits halfway between them

If halfVector and surfaceNormal match, then we're at perfect reflection angle
How to tell if match? dot product

1st
	Pass in camera position, work out, surface to camera position vector

2nd
	Compute halfVector between: surfaceToCamera, and surfaceToLight

3rd 
	dot product, and take normal to find out if reflecting into camera
