Project description 

	Mars mission control game in WebGL

	Basically, the user plays as a rover, roaming around mars
		exploring and completeing various challenges.

	WebGL, standing for Web Graphics libary is a JavaScript
		API for rendering graphics in a browser. 

	WebGL lets you display triangles on the screen, doesn't do much more than that.
		Theres no ability to drag and drop objects into a premade 3D scene
		It's from scratch basically
		
	webgl vs opengl vs directx

		decided on webgl because benefits of the browser
		OpenGL would mean I have to write in c++ which is already challenging enough
			let alone opengl on top.
		I'd rather use webgl (which is basically opengl) but with JavaScript
			so I could focus on the webgl side, and have solid underlying
			javascript code

		directX i had absoultey no experience with, as it isnt based off opengl
			also its windows only,

Technical
	
	basic game render loop
		update() 
		render()

	Use a projection matrix to convert my 3D world into 2D screenspace
		illusion of 3d

	Show terrain generation, 
		some detail of perlin noise and smooth randomness
		Rendering efficiency vs no efficiency
		
	
Work left to do
