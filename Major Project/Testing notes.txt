To see if browser supports at least webgl v1
http://webglreport.com/?v=1
But im adding some extension libraries, so needs to support webgl v2 as well
http://webglreport.com/?v=2

All of the webgl testing tools are only for webgl v1 without extensions, so cant use them

UI testing, and unit testing, should be ok

Things I can test:
	
	JavaScript tests: terrainTester, rocktester etc
		User input and changing values, restarting scene etc
		That buffers get created properly, arent null
		Testing when you move mouse, it moves scene
			Stops going out of range
		Correct amount of vertices/indices ratio


	Test table:
		Test collision works

	Notes/screenshots:
		The link above,
		Cross browser, firefox/chrome testing
		that all features of the scene work


	WebGL console errors

	Memory usage
		See how rocks affect this etc
	FPS tests
		see how rocks effect this etc

Testing rendering output is infeasible

	Checking rendering results on hardware is just not realisitc, some sort of
	drivers would have to be written for this

	Also even if I did this, results would be different on 
	different computers/drivers so would fail

All I can test is the data I give to WebGL, not how its displayed,
unless you can write your own implementation of the webgl api, to see all the calls
'mocking framework'
