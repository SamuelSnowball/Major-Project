# Major-Project

## Info
My final year project, a prehistoric Mars scene created with WebGL and JavaScript.

The scene demonstrates how Mars would've looked around 2-4 billion years ago. 

The project is being developed using the SCRUM methodology.

A release version is published at the end of every sprint.

## Screenshots

## Inspiration

This is what I'm <b>basing my scene off</b>: an artist's impression of how Mars may have looked four billion years ago.
