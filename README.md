# Major-Project

## Info
My final year project, a prehistoric Mars scene created with WebGL and JavaScript.

The scene demonstrates how Mars would've looked around 2-4 billion years ago. 

The project is being developed using the SCRUM methodology.

A release version is published at the end of every sprint.

To see private methods as well, click the "Private" checkbox in the top right options panel. <br>
The "index" tab isn't working properly, when you click a method it doesn't re-direct properly. So just go on the "Methods panel to view them"<br>
